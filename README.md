## ResultLib
ResultLib was born from my passion for **Rust** and my deep love for **C#**. As a strong advocate of the **Result pattern**, I strive to minimize the use of `try/catch` blocks whenever possible. While exceptions are a fundamental part of C#'s design, this library provides a structured approach to **error handling** that aligns with the principles of functional programming and type safety.

With these **lightweight structs**, I can write more expressive and predictable codeâ€”reducing reliance on exception-driven control flow while keeping the logic clean and efficient.

I welcome **your feedback, suggestions, and contributions** to improve this project further. Let's build something powerful together!

### Unity Compatible
